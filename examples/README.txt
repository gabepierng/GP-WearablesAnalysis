RAS Investigation: LLA_gaitmonitoring.py
PT data: PT_LLA_similarity.py

Jupyter notebooks are mainly used for sandbox testing

NOTE - I don't call anything from src (gait_metrics or excel_reader) in my code. The excel reader and gait_metrics file are both directly in the examples folder.


Other things to note:
excel_reader_gcp_GN.py 
- Contains changes to the normal excel_reader file that were used to calculate the INI
